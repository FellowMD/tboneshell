This is a random stab at merging Gary Bernhardt's [functional core, imperative shell][das-fcis] with reactive programming, using the [TBone][tbone] library.
I was introduced to the functional core idea by [this][das-boundaries] talk of his, and it crystalized some thoughts I had about why some code lends itself to maintainance and testing, while some code makes it difficult. I highly recommend watching it.
